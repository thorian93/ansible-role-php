## Known issues

None.

## Requirements

No special requirements; note that this role requires root access, so either run it in a playbook with a global `become: yes`, or invoke the role in your playbook like:

    - hosts: foobar
      roles:
        - role: ansible-role-php
          become: yes

## Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see `defaults/main.yml`):

    php_major_version: 7

Define the major PHP version.

    php_minor_version: 4

Define the minor PHP version.

    php_third_party_enabled: 'false'

Decide if a third party repository should be used. For details on those repositories see the `vars/` folder for the respective distribution. Probably this role will fail, if the third party repository is not enabled.

    php_ppa_enabled: 'false'
    php_ppa: "ppa:ondrej/php"

Decide if an Ubuntu PPS should be used and if yes which. The default is the well known [Sury](https://deb.sury.org/) repository. Probably this role will fail, if the PPA for Ubuntu is not enabled.

    php_enabled_modules:
    - curl

Decide which PHP module should be installed.

    php_config_options: []

Provide additional PHP configuration.

## Dependencies

*For webserver detection.*

## OS Compatibility

This role ensures that it is not used against unsupported or untested operating systems by checking, if the right distribution name and major version number are present in a dedicated variable named like `<role-name>_stable_os`. You can find the variable in the role's default variable file at `defaults/main.yml`:

    role_stable_os:
      - Debian 10
      - Ubuntu 18
      - CentOS 7
      - Fedora 30

If the combination of distribution and major version number do not match the target system, the role will fail. To allow the role to work add the distribution name and major version name to that variable and you are good to go. But please test the new combination first!

Kudos to [HarryHarcourt](https://github.com/HarryHarcourt) for this idea!
